# Overview
This project outlines an NB-IoT weather station built using the SIM7020 NB-IoT module and the BME680 environmental sensor. The system is designed to monitor local weather conditions—temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and air quality—and transmit the data to Thingsboard IoT platform via NB-IoT for low-power, wide-area connectivity. This setup is ideal for remote environmental monitoring in applications such as agriculture, smart cities, or research stations.
